        question: "What is neuroplasticity?",
        answer: "Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life in response to internal and external stimuli."
      },
      {
        id: "easy",
        question: "What is long-term potentiation (LTP)?",
        answer: "Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a persistent strengthening of synapses based on recent patterns of activity. It is widely believed to be a cellular mechanism for learning and memory."
      },

        id: "medium",
        question: "What is the role of the hippocampus in learning and memory?",
        answer: "The hippocampus is a brain region that is critical for the formation and retrieval of declarative memories, which are memories that can be consciously recalled, such as facts and events."
      },
      {
        id: "medium",
        question: "What is the difference between implicit and explicit memory?",
        answer: "Implicit memory refers to the unconscious influence of a previous experience on a current behavior or thought, while explicit memory refers to the conscious, intentional recollection of past events or information."
      },
      {
        id: "hard",
        question: "What is the role of dopamine in learning and reward?",
        answer: "Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a key role in the brain's reward system. It is released in response to stimuli that are associated with rewards, and it reinforces behaviors that lead to positive outcomes."
      },
      {
        id: "hard",
        question: "What is the role of epigenetics in learning and memory?",
        answer: "Epigenetics is the study of changes in gene expression that do not involve changes to the underlying DNA sequence. It has been shown to play a role in the formation and consolidation of memories in the brain."
      },
      {
        id: "easy",
        question: "What is the relationship between attention and learning?",
        answer: "Attention is necessary for learning because it helps to filter out irrelevant information and focus on important stimuli. Without attention, information may not be encoded properly and may be forgotten."
      },
      {
        id: "medium",
        question: "What is the role of the prefrontal cortex in decision-making and learning?",
        answer: "The prefrontal cortex is a brain region that is important for executive functions such as decision-making, problem-solving, and working memory. It is also involved in learning and memory processes."
      },
      {
        id: "hard",
        question: "What is the relationship between stress and learning?",
        answer: "Stress can have both positive and negative effects on learning. Moderate stress can enhance learning and memory, while chronic or extreme stress can impair cognitive function and lead to memory problems."
      },
      {
        id: "medium",
        question: "What are the neural mechanisms underlying perceptual learning?",
        answer: "Perceptual learning involves changes in the brain's sensory processing pathways that result in improved perception of specific stimuli over time. These changes may involve modifications to neural connections or changes in neural firing patterns."
